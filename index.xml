&lt;h1 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comprehend Medical is a stateless and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) eligible Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relationship Extraction (RE) service launched under Amazon Web Services (AWS) trained using state-of-the-art deep learning models. Contrary to many existing open source tools, Comprehend Medical is scalable and does not require steep learning curve, dependencies, pipeline configurations, or installations. Currently, Comprehend Medical performs NER in five medical categories: Anatomy, Medical Condition, Medications, Protected Health Information (PHI) and Treatment, Test and Procedure (TTP). Additionally, the service provides relationship extraction for the detected entities as well as contextual information such as negation and temporality in the form of traits. Comprehend Medical provides two Application Programming Interfaces (API): 1) the NERe API which returns all the extracted named entities, their traits and the relationships between them and 2) the PHId API which returns just the protected health information contained in the text. Furthermore, Comprehend Medical is accessible through AWS Console, Java and Python Software Development Kit (SDK), making it easier for non-developers and developers to use.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Joint Entity Extraction and Assertion Detection for Clinical Text</title>
      <link>https://mohammedkhalilia.com/publication/joint-entity-assertion-detection/</link>

&lt;h1 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Negative medical findings are prevalent in clinical reports, yet discriminating them from positive findings remains a challenging task for in-formation extraction. Most of the existing systems treat this task as a pipeline of two separate tasks, i.e., named entity recognition (NER)and rule-based negation detection. We consider this as a multi-task problem and present a novel end-to-end neural model to jointly extract entities and negations. We extend a standard hierarchical encoder-decoder NER model and first adopt a shared encoder followed by separate decoders for the two tasks. This architecture performs considerably better than the previous rule-based and machine learning-based systems. To overcome the problem of increased parameter size especially for low-resource settings, we propose the Conditional Softmax Shared Decoder architecture which achieves state-of-art results for NER and negation detection on the 2010 i2b2/VA challenge dataset and a proprietary de-identified clinical dataset.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Improving Hospital Mortality Prediction with Medical Named Entities and Multimodal Learning</title>

&lt;h1 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clinical text provides essential information to estimate the acuity of a patient during hospital stays in addition to structured clinical data. In this study, we explore how clinical text can complement a clinical predictive learning task. We leverage an internal medical natural language processing service to perform named entity extraction and negation detection on clinical notes and compose selected entities into a new text corpus to train document representations. We then propose a multimodal neural network to jointly train time series signals and unstructured clinical text representations to predict the in-hospital mortality risk for ICU patients. Our model outperforms the benchmark by 2% AUC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Objective. To develop a systematic and reproducible way to identify patients at increased risk for higher healthcare costs. Methods. Medical records were analyzed for 9,581 adults who were primary care patients in the University of Missouri Health System and who were enrolled in Medicare or Medicaid. Patients were categorized into one of four risk tiers as of October 1, 2013, and the four tiers were compared on demographic characteristics, number of healthcare episodes, and healthcare charges in the year before and the year after cohort formation. Results. The mean number of healthcare episodes and the sum of healthcare charges in the year following cohort formation were higher for patients in the higher-risk tiers. Conclusions. Retrospective information that is easily extracted from medical records can be used to create risk tiers that provide highly useful information about the prospective risk of healthcare utilization and costs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cloud-based predictive modeling for asthma readmission</title>
      <link>https://mohammedkhalilia.com/project/predictive-model-cloud/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The predictive modeling process is time consuming and requires clinical researchers to handle complex EHR data in restricted computational environments. To address this problem, we implemented a cloud-based predictive modeling system via a hybrid setup combining a secure private server with the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic MapReduce platform. EHR data is preprocessed on a private server and the resulting event sequences are hosted on AWS. Based on user-specified configurations, an on-demand web service launches a cluster of Elastic Compute 2 (EC2) instances on AWS to perform feature selection and classification algorithms in a distributed fashion. Afterwards, the secure private server aggregates results and displays them via interactive visualizations. We tested the system on an asthma patient readmission task on a de-identified EHR dataset of 2,967 patients. We conduct a larger scale experiment on the CMS Linkable 2008-2010 Medicare Data Entrepreneurs’ Synthetic Public Use File dataset of 2 million patients, which achieves over 25-fold speedup than sequential execution.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Clustering patients using activity of daily living scores</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Stratification is a valuable technique for providing an insight on the structure of the patient population based on some features such as Activity of Daily Living (ADL) scores. Grouping patients can play an important role in designing clinical trials or improving care delivery. In this paper, we present a method for stratifying patients based on their ADL scores. Every patient is represented by a time series consisting of ADL scores recorded over a period of up to two years. This approach relies on Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) technique to measure the similarity between two time series and then using Relational Self-Organizing Maps (RSOM) to discover patient clusters. The analysis was performed on a population of 6,000 patients. Six clusters were discovered: patients with high risk and steady ADL trajectory, low risk and steady trajectory, patients with sudden ADL score jumps, patients with declining ADL score and others with steady inclining trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The aim is to build a reliable prediction model for predicting the optimal treatment of an epilepsy patient. The model will rely on an individual patient’s past history, and predict the treatment most likely to achieve a positive outcome. We are working with longitudinal data and thus, define index dates for the patients. Data from before the index date serves as input available at decision time, while data from after that point in time allows us to extract outcome values and characterize the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Quantifying care coordination</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This research identifies specific care coordination activities used by Aging In Place (AIP) nurse care coordinators and home healthcare nurses when coordinating care for older community dwelling adults and suggests a method to quantify care coordination. A care coordination ontology was built based on activities extracted from 11,038 notes labeled with the Omaha Case Management category. From the parsed narrative notes of every patient, we mapped the extracted activities to the ontology, from which we computed problem profiles and quantified care coordination for all patients. We compared two groups of patients: Aging in Place who received enhanced care coordination (n=217) and Home Healthcare (HHC) who received traditional care (n=691) using 128,135 narratives notes. Patients were tracked from the time they were admitted to AIP or HHC until they were discharged. We found that patients in AIP received a higher dose of care coordination than HHC in most Omaha problems, with larger doses being given in AIP than in HHC in all four Omaha categories. “Communicate” and “manage” activities are widely used in care coordination. That confirmed the expert hypothesis that nurse care coordinators spent most of their time communicating about their patients and managing problems. Overall, nurses performed care coordination in both AIP and HHC, but the aggregated dose across Omaha problems and categories is larger in AIP.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Comparing Aging in Place to Home Health Care: Impact of Nurse Care Coordination On Utilization and Costs</title>

&lt;h1 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the chronically ill, care delivered in the home is a lifeline to the self-management of chronic conditions. Currently, 90% of Americans age 75 and older have at least one chronic medical condition, and 20% have five or more chronic illnesses (AARP, 2009). The cost of caring for people with five or more chronic illnesses is roughly 17 times higher than for those without chronic illness (Bodenheimer &amp;amp; Berry-Millett, 2009). The complexity of the health care system makes it nearly impossible for patients and families to understand how various services work together, identify what legitimate and feasible demands can be made of providers, and learn how to obtain medical information in a timely and efficient manner (Anderson &amp;amp; Horvath, 2004; Smith, Saunders, Stuckhardt, &amp;amp; McGinnis, 2012). Care coordination is increasingly seen as a way to help patients, families, or other support networks manage medical conditions, and social and psychological problems more effectively (Yang &amp;amp; Meiners, 2014). The impact of care coordination on utilization and cost outcomes in older adults living in the community and receiving long-term nurse care coordination through Aging in Place (AIP) or routine care through home health care (HHC) is reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clinical predictive modeling involves two challenging tasks: model development and model deployment. In this paper we demonstrate a software architecture for developing and deploying clinical predictive models using web services via the Health Level 7 (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard. The services enable model development using electronic health records (EHRs) stored in OMOP CDM databases and model deployment for scoring individual patients through FHIR resources. The MIMIC2 ICU dataset and a synthetic outpatient dataset were transformed into OMOP CDM databases for predictive model development. The resulting predictive models are deployed as FHIR resources, which receive requests of patient information, perform prediction against the deployed predictive model and respond with prediction scores. To assess the practicality of this approach we evaluated the response and prediction time of the FHIR modeling web services. We found the system to be reasonably fast with one second total response time per patient prediction.&lt;/p&gt;
